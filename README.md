# To-Do with MFEs and Clean Arch

This is a to-do app example with a micro front-ends and clean architecture.

## What is MFEs?

This project have MFEs in a monorepo strategy. The MFEs means `Micro Front-Ends`. It is a way to split the front-end application into small parts, which can be developed, tested, and deployed independently if you want. This approach can help you to scale your front-end application.

## How to run

Only run the main.dart file in the `lib` folder, like any other Flutter project.

## Dependency Injection and Navigation

This project uses the `flutter_modular` package to manage the dependency injection and navigation. You can see more details about the package [here](https://modular.flutterando.com.br/docs/flutter_modular/start/).
